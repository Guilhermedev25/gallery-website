# Gallery Website 🌟

Hi there! This is my first responsive gallery website project. I'm learning web development and decided to create a photo gallery with a cool hamburger menu for mobile devices.

## What I Built 📸

A simple but beautiful photo gallery website that works great on both desktop and mobile phones. It has:

- **Responsive design** - looks good on any screen size
- **Hamburger menu** - cool mobile menu that slides in from the side
- **Photo categories** - 9 different photo categories to explore
- **Hover effects** - photos change when you hover over them
- **Smooth animations** - everything moves smoothly

## Technologies I Used 🛠️

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with SASS)

## How to Use 🚀

1. Download or clone this project
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Try resizing the window to see the responsive design
